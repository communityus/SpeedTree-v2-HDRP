# SpeedTree-v2-HDRP
ORCA SpeedTree v2 HDRP with Shader Graph

Adapts a copy of version 2 of the UE4 Sun Temple assets from the NVIDIA's ORCA Project, which can be found at https://developer.nvidia.com/orca. 

Simply put, the assets aren't well formated for Unity, and I'm trying to change that. In this specific repo, I'm adapting the assets to Unity 2018.4 and HDRP. I used Unity's Shader Graph to create shaders that work with the supplied textures.

ORCA has some really nice assets, and I think that it's a shame that they don't work with Unity right out of the box.
